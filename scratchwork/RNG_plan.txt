random number algorithm: 
linear feedback shift register!
needs to be seeded via human iniput somehow


random number seed: from timer!
on game bootup, start from menu (stretch goal) or from "Ready?" screen
player must press something (fire button? center board button?) to begin the game
read timer1 at that instant, get its value, use as random seed!
human input (delay) becomes random seed
