KNOWN BUGS:

cannot load software via USART, don't know why (using the MEMLOADER program and getting it inside the bitstream with .txt files works)
	(even the official bitstream submitted for the assignment can't load software via USART !!! how did this get missed???)
	(need to backtrack thru git history until finding a version that didn't have this bug...)
	(might be due to slowing down the core clock from 50mhz to 25mhz, but unlikely)
	(probably related to the way sprite ram was added and is managed via "snooping"...?)
	(I don't understand the graphics even a little bit so this will probably never be fixed)
sprite system is buggy: designed to support 16 sprites on a line, but can only handle 12, 13-16 look "glitchy"
	(I don't understand the graphics even a little bit so this will probably never be fixed)
