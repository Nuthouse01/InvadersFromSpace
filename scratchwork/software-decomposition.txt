each of the following things needs a module written for it. "modules" here are _conceptual_ blocks - they don't need their own subroutines or files, but we will probably be using multiple files anyway.

poll input from user
player bullet generation
enemy AI step (compute movement, enemy bullet generation)

movement step:
    player
    bullets
    enemies

collision checks:
    player/bounds (player is trying to move off the screen)
    player/enemy bullet
    enemy/player bullet
    bullet/block

bullet effects:
    destroy (set destroyed flag) player if hit
        logic to handle game over
    destroy (set destroyed flag) enemy if hit
        logic to increment score
    damage block if hit
        check for destruction, remove block entirely if necessary

graphics effects:
    draw player
        explosion animation check?
    draw enemies
        explosion animation check?
    draw blocks
    draw score
