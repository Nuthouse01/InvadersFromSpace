/////////////////////////////////////////////
main{

load sprite table
set sprites to be disabled or off screen
more init?

basic:
	set LEDs to be animating somehow (still showing black screen)
	wait for any button press
	wait for all buttons to be released
	seed the random LFSR
advanced:
	load menu screen (as a background) and cursor
	continually reading paddle to move cursor
	options are start 1-player, start 2-player, view high scores (yes high score will be reset on power down, whatever)
	run whichever option is under cursor when button released

begin "game" (separate file/function)(takes 1-player or 2-player as argument)
	do game-init stuff like reset score, lives, more?
	begin "wave"
		do wave-init stuff like reset enemy positions & speeds, bunkers, more?
		(beginning of the scheduler loop)
		(player/enemies are now visible but frozen, scheduler targets not set)
		play brief opening fanfare, wait until its done, then set the scheduler targets
		run the "normal wave logic" (run until wave complete or game over)
			...
			...
			...
			...
	if wave complete, begin next "wave", don't reset score/lives
	on losing, exit function & return score, add to "high score list" (if we have that feature)
reset icons to be off screen or whatever
go back to "main menu" or black-screen-waiting-for-input
	


}

////////////////////////////////////////////////
"main menu"/boot/init stuff should be its own file, probably actual main
game/wave/collision/fire bullet all together, probably?
